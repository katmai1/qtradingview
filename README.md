#### Troubleshot

##### Database issues after an update

Probably the last update does changes into database and this changes are not applied automatically. You can try update tables manually.
    

```
- If running from source:
    python apprun.py --updatedb

- If running compiled release:
    qtradingview --updatedb

* This function works fine whe running from source code, with a compiled version sometimes not update correctly.
```

If issue persist you can delete database to force his create again.

```
- If running from source:
    python apprun.py --deletedb

- If running compiled release:
    qtradingview --deletedb
```
